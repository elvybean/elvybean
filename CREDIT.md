# GitHub README profile widgets sources
*The below text will be added to the bottom of elvybean/README.md once I figure out why it displays inline with the contents of "Github Statsâš¡" and not below them*

## Widget Sources
- skill icons are from [tandpfun/skill-icons](https://github.com/tandpfun/skill-icons).
- spotify widget is from [kittinan/spotify-github-profile](https://github.com/kittinan/spotify-github-profile). I am using the widget's default configuration and theme.
- github commit stats is from [DenverCoder1/github-readme-streak-stats](https://github.com/DenverCoder1/github-readme-streak-stats). I have the widget set to display private commits and it is using the ```shades of purple```  theme.
- github programming langauge usage stats are from [anuraghazra/github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats). I have the widget set to display as a pie chart and it is also using the ```shades of purple``` theme.
