# GitHub README profile widgets sources

- the skill icons are from [tandpfun/skill-icons](https://github.com/tandpfun/skill-icons).
- the spotify widget is from [kittinan/spotify-github-profile](https://github.com/kittinan/spotify-github-profile). I'm using the widget's default configuration except the cover art is set to not display.
- the commit stats is from [DenverCoder1/github-readme-streak-stats](https://github.com/DenverCoder1/github-readme-streak-stats). I have the widget set to display private commits and it is using the ```shades of purple```  theme.
- the programming langauge usage stats are from [anuraghazra/github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats). I have the widget set to display as a donut chart and it is also using the ```shades of purple``` theme.
